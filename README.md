**************************************** PROJECT CRITERIA ************************************************

1. Smart Contract Seperation
  1) FlightSuretyData.sol for data persistence
  2) FlightSuretyApp.sol for app logic and oracles code 
  ** DONE **

2. Dapp Created and Used for Contract Calls
A Dapp client has been created and is used for triggering contract calls. Client can be launched with “npm run dapp” and is available at http://localhost:8000

Specific contract calls:
